      "message": "Something that I just noticed, in the event manager, we only do the A\u0026AI queries if vserver.is-closed-loop-disabled is missing. That works for the other use cases but not for VoLTE. If DCAE sends an onset with vserver.is-closed-loop-disabled and other required fields for the VFC request are missing, this vnfResponse object is going to be null and can cause null pointer exceptions.",
