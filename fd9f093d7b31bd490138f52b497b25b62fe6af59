It does not retain a copy of the original file, as it is not needed when this feature is enabled - the assembly ensures that the aggregated property file copied from the test directory is the one that is installed and used instead.",

      "message": "I think I got what\u0027s going on, the packaged file under config/ does not have the same name, and it is only one file, grouping all http clients, so this does not override the existing official files, AAI, SO, etc .. it is a totally brand new name, so there is no conflict here, because the names are different.\n\nUtkarsh, can you write a comment above in this file, about the strategy taken here, as it is not intuitive.  The key thing to write down for others to make sense of it, is that there is no interference in the naming of the replacement file, as there is a single one, named differently than the official ones.",
