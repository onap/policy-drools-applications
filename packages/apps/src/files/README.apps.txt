The PDP-D apps installation package contains:

1. artifacts-<version>.zip contains models and other jars to support PDP-D applications.
2. basex-<version>.tar.gz contains scripts and additional files to support the PDP-D models.

The apps-<version>.zip must be placed in the same directory as the installation package
before installation before installation is attempted.
