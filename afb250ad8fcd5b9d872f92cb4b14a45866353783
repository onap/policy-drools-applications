      "message": "This is an example of the old quote: \"if you can\u0027t fix it, feature it\". In this case, you try to send a message via \u0027Util.deliver\u0027, it fails, and you declare victory!\n\nI think it would be better to fix it -- my original comment was as follows:\n\n        // throws an exception:\n        //     java.lang.IllegalStateException: Policy Engine is stopped\n        // if policy engine is started, it still throws an exception:\n        //     java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: no reverse coder has been found\n        //assertTrue(Util.deliver(\"testTopic\", \"test\"));\n\nI now realize what is needed -- in addition to starting the Policy Engine, I believe you need to create at least one controller, which includes the following properties:\n\nnoop.sink.topics\u003dtestTopic\nnoop.sink.topics.testTopic.events\u003djava.lang.String\n\nIt\u0027s also possible that you can just add the following \u0027props.put\u0027 (I\u0027m not sure about this):\n\nprop.put(\"noop.sink.topics.testTopic.events\", \"java.lang.String\");",
