      "message": "When I tested this for vDNS it is the operationRequest that is null as a result of a failed named query. So what I can do is set the policyResult to \"FAILURE\" so that there are no null values when it gets to finishOperation. The result of finishOperation will then be: Finishing VF Module Create result is Failure. I think it\u0027s okay to keep this solution for vDNS only",
