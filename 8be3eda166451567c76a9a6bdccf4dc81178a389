      "message": "need parent pom files (see previous version of file where the parent was included).   If there are multiple parents, include all of them.\n\nI mean the changes in this file should not be so hard, just follow the same pattern as the original one which was working.   The ONAP dependencies fo the control loop plus the ONAP parent poms that you restructured as you put in the \u003cparent\u003e section of the pom.xml of the dependencies, ie. aai, mso, ..\n\nThink of it runtime dependencies, what ONAP artifacts do you need in the nexus repository, for your runtime control loop to be able to resolve all ONAP dependencies and run.\n\nSimilar as before, but taking into account the restructuring you did.",
