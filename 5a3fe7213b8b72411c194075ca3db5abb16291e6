We have adopted the convention of \"unix\" style name, with \"-\" as word separators instead of other word separators such as \"_\", camel case, etc ..   This is not goiong to be end up in a file under a pdp-d directory but will be good for consistency.   Note in a pdp-d installation the file naming is consistent with what I described above.",
