      "message": "Thought about making it configurable, but didn\u0027t seem necessary, as this is always tacked onto the end of the operationTime, which is already configurable.  Lock requesters are expected to unlock the lock within \"operationTime\" seconds from the time that it last requested OR extended the lock.  If the requester fails to unlock it, then the locking code will automatically unlock it at the specified time (i.e., operationTime + ADDITIONAL_LOCK_SEC).",
